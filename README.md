**Calculation of the Internal Rate of Return**
This repo enables the calculation of the internal rate of return (irr) of given cashflows. 
Until now two options are available: 
1. Enter a date and a cashflow that has been made on this date; afterwards a list of all of the cashflows is shown and the irr will be calculated.
   - For entering the date, there are several options to enter it:
      - Hit "Enter": This will add the date of today as a date to the list.
      - Enter a date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" or "dd.mm.yyyy"
      - Enter the difference in days in an int format e.g. -1, -7
   - Then enter the cashflow for that specific date. This can be one consolidated cashflow or a sum of single cashflows. 
2. Only show past cashflows and show the irr of them without adding a new tuple to the list.
